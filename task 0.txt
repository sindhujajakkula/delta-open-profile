I started to learn programming after 12th class. Initially, I started with C and Python but later I thought of learning one language completely first, so I continued with python. I was able to learn python so soon, may be the credit goes to its simplicity, and this encouraged me to learn more and more. I initially learned by watching Python YouTube tutorials, and other educational platforms and later in the 2nd semester, I had python language in Introduction to CS course. 

Coming to projects, I did  projectile motion animation in VPython as an assignment, where it takes inputs of the intial conditions of the ball. I did 2 simple games using loops, functions and random module. I did a image difference game in opencv where the user needs to input 2 images and differences in the images is displayed as output.  Long back I used to play a game called rush. I like that game. I wanted to create a game similar to rush. But before that I thought I should familiarise myself with basic programming languages. I am presently interested in learning game devlopment. 
So, I would be grateful, if you could guide me to learn game dev in a right way.
